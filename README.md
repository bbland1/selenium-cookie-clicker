# selenium-cookie-clicker

This code uses selenium to automate control of the classic version of [cookie clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/) in safari, to use it in the other browsers the proper driver would need to be downloaded and `driver = webdriver.Safari()` would need to changed to the proper browser. It is a simple way to automatically play the game. It click the main cookie and buy the most expensive upgrade it can affor every 5 seconds within a 5 minute window. 

**Highlights:**
Getting this to actually work. There were some hiccups with the scraping of the info and getting it to be usable numbers but eventually got it there and I was really excited.
